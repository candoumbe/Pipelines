## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] / 2023-12-15
### üö® Breaking changes

- Dropped `IHaveSecret` component ([#94](https://github.com/candoumbe/Pipelines/issues/94))

### üßπ Housekeeping

- Adopted the new C#12 syntax
- Added support for net8.0

## [0.7.0] / 2023-09-23
### üöÄ New features

- Added `IDoHotfixWorkflow` component which represents the `hotfix` workflow
- Added `IDoFeatureWorkflow` component which represents the `feature` workflow
- Added `IDoColdfixWorkflow` component which represents the `coldfix` workflow
- `ICreateGithubRelease.Assets` property can be used to specify which artifacts to associate with a Github release ([#103](https://github.com/candoumbe/Pipelines/issues/103))
- `IMutationTest` component can send `--config-file` option to Stryker CLI ([#90](https://github.com/candoumbe/Pipelines/issues/90))

### üö® Breaking changes

- Removed `Github.IPullRequest.Token` property. This property was previously used by `GitHub.IGitFlowWithPullRequest` and `GitHub.IGitFlowWithPullRequest` when finishing a feature/coldfix is.
- Refactored `IWorkflow` component and removed inheritance from `IHaveMainBranch` component
- Refactored `ICompile` component to no longer extend `IRestore` component
- Refactored `IPack` component to no longer extend `ICompile` component
- Refactored `IMutationTest.MutationTestsProjects` type from `(Project SourceProject, IEnumerable<Project> TestsProjects)` to [`MutationTestProjectConfiguration`](./src/Candoumbe.Pipelines/Components/IMutationTest.cs):
this new type allows to specify the path to the configuration file to use during each mutation test run.
- `IMutationTest` component no longer implements `IUnitTest` but only `IHaveTests`

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes

- Removed `nofetch` option (when calling `gitversion` tool) in order to compute semver version number more accurately ([#96](https://github.com/candoumbe/Pipelines/issues/96)).

- Marked `IMutationTest.StrykerDashboardApiKey` property as a secret ([#110](https://github.com/candoumbe/Pipelines/issues/110)).

### üßπ Housekeeping

- Refactoring of `IMutationTest` component to improve maintenability : the way CLI options required by Stryker are computed is now centralized.
- Added `GitHubToken` value in `parameters.local.json` : this value will be consumed directly to interact with the github repository.
- `IGitflow`, `IGithubflow` components extends `IDoHotfixWorkflow` component
- `IGitflow`, `IGithubflow` components extends `IDoHotfixWorkflow` component
- Added `NugetApi` valuen in `parameters.local.json` to interact directly with NuGet from local environment
- Added documentation for `IMutationTest` classes
